# Dopo — Project Status & Plan
### Updated: February 17, 2026 (Early Morning)

---

## Executive Summary

Dopo is a social curation platform for saved social media content — "Pinterest for your social media saves." Users save content from Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, X, and Facebook into one searchable, AI-enriched library. The strategic differentiator is the social discovery layer (public collections, follow graph, collaborative curation) that no competitor has built.

**Model:** Claude as CTO + iOS Contractor Execution
**Stack:** Native iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) + Supabase Backend + AI Pipeline
**Domain:** dopoapp.com
**Demo:** dopo-demo.vercel.app
**Landing Page:** dopoapp.com (live, waitlist active)

- [x] Duplicate detection via canonical URL matching
- [x] Auto-triggers ai-enrich on every save (fire-and-forget)

### Library API (Complete — v10)
- [x] `library` edge function (v10) — GET (list/search), DELETE, PATCH (favorite/note/tags)
- [x] Full-text search via `search_saves` RPC with platform/content-type filtering
- [x] Fuzzy ILIKE fallback when full-text returns zero results
- [x] Pagination support (limit/offset)
- [x] Collections CRUD — create, list, add/remove saves, rename, delete
- [x] Collection filtering — list saves by collection
- [x] Collection membership returned with each save
- [x] Share collections — toggle public/private, generate shareable link
- [x] Public shared view — unauthenticated read-only collection viewing via share_token
- [x] Collaborator management — invite by email, auto-accept existing users, remove collaborators
- [x] Collaborator access — editors can add/remove saves from shared collections
- [x] Cross-user collection viewing — collaborators see owner's saves in shared collections
- [x] View-only vs Editor roles — role selector on invite, role badges, role switching, UI enforcement

### AI Metadata Extraction (Complete — v13)
- [x] `ai-enrich` edge function (v13) with Gemini 2.0 Flash integration
- [x] Rule-based fallback when Gemini unavailable
- [x] Single save, batch, force re-enrich, and debug modes
- [x] 18 content categories supported
- [x] All saves enriched with AI tags and categories (8-15 tags per save, broad conceptual coverage)
- [x] GEMINI_API_KEY configured in Supabase secrets
- [x] 768-dim semantic embeddings via Gemini embedding-001
- [x] All 35 saves have embeddings stored in pgvector column

### AI-Powered Semantic Search (Complete — smart-search v3)
- [x] pgvector extension enabled with HNSW index (cosine similarity)
- [x] `semantic_search` PostgreSQL RPC function for vector similarity queries
- [x] `smart-search` edge function (v3) with full NLP pipeline:
  - Temporal NLP parser (last week, last month, yesterday, N days/weeks/months ago, recently, etc.)
  - Platform detection from natural language ("on YouTube", "from Instagram")
  - Content type detection (video, reel, photo, article)
  - Filler word removal ("I watched", "I saved", "about", "related to")
  - Query embedding via Gemini embedding-001 (RETRIEVAL_QUERY task type)
  - Hybrid ranking: vector similarity (0.7 weight) + keyword FTS (0.3 weight)
- [x] Tested and verified:
  - "Jesus" → Biblical discovery, spiritual practices, Christian content (top 4 results)
  - "football training drills" → All top 5 are football training content (0.79 hybrid score)
  - "I watched a video on wide receiver routes last week" → WR-specific content with temporal filter
  - "AI and technology" → Tech content surfaces correctly

### iOS App (In Progress — v1 Scaffold Complete)

## Edge Functions Registry

| Function | Version | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `ingest` | v10 | URL parsing + metadata enrichment + auto-enrich trigger | ACTIVE |
| `library` | v10 | CRUD + search + collections + sharing + collaborators + cross-user collection saves | ACTIVE |

## Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Facebook saves often show "Log into Facebook" as title | Medium | Microlink hits Facebook's login wall; metadata extraction limited |
| No TikTok saves in DB | Low | Parser works, just no test content ingested yet |
| Leaked password protection disabled | Low | Requires Supabase Pro plan; not worth upgrading yet |
| Waitlist RLS policy is INSERT WITH CHECK (true) | Low | Intentional for public waitlist; acceptable |
| No email notifications for collaborator invites | Low | Needs transactional email service (Resend/SendGrid) |
| Shared view URL uses query param | Low | `?shared=TOKEN` works but `/c/:token` route cleaner for production |

### 🔥 Current Priority: Wire Search into Apps

### Next Phase (Weeks 2-3)
6. **Add TikTok test saves** — demonstrate 5-platform coverage
7. **Fix Facebook enrichment** — alternative metadata sources or manual override
8. **User profiles page** — public profile with collections grid, bio, save count
9. **Follow graph** — follow users, discovery feed of public collections
10. **Notification system** — collaborator invites, new saves in shared collections
11. **Register social handles** (@dopo / @getdopo on X, Instagram, TikTok)

### Phase 0 Gate (Requires iOS Contractor)
12. **iOS Share Extension POC** — Instagram + YouTube capture via share sheet
13. **TestFlight deployment** for personal testing
14. **App Store submission** for beta

### Production Readiness
15. **Dedicated share routes** — `/c/:token` instead of `?shared=token`
16. **Rate limiting** on ingest and API endpoints
17. **Image proxy/CDN** for thumbnails (reliability + privacy)
18. **Supabase Pro upgrade** — leaked password protection, higher limits
19. **File provisional patent** — guide ready, needs execution

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Jan 15 | Supabase over Firebase | Better SQL querying for search features |
| Jan 15 | Native Swift over React Native | Share extensions are first-class in native |
| Jan 15 | AI-native from day 1 | Core differentiator; compress development 50% |
| Feb 12 | YouTube + Instagram first | YouTube = cleanest URLs, Instagram = highest demand |
| Feb 12 | Claude as CTO model | Non-technical founder; AI handles architecture |
| Feb 13 | Gemini 2.0 Flash for dev | Free tier sufficient for prototype |
| Feb 14 | Vercel for demo hosting | Supabase blocks HTML serving in edge functions |
| Feb 14 | Rule-based + AI hybrid | Fallback enrichment when API unavailable |
| Feb 15 | Option B: Social curation | Private utility = dead (Pocket). Social = platform (Pinterest) |
| Feb 15 | Collaborative collections | 5th retention loop; group obligation mechanic |
| Feb 16 | Collections UI + Share/Collab shipped same day | Backend was ready; front-end build validated full stack |
| Feb 16 | Auto-accept collaborator invites for existing users | Simpler for demo; pending invites stored for future signups |
| Feb 16 | Share token on query param for MVP | `?shared=TOKEN` avoids routing complexity; clean URL in production |
| Feb 16 | iOS app scaffold built in single session | Validated full SwiftUI + Supabase integration end-to-end |
| Feb 16 | pgvector for semantic search | Keyword search can't handle "Jesus" → Christianity; embeddings required |
| Feb 16 | Gemini embedding-001 (768-dim truncated) | Only embedding model available on free tier; outputDimensionality=768 fits HNSW 2000-dim limit |
| Feb 16 | Hybrid search (vector + FTS + temporal) | Best of all worlds: meaning, keywords, and time-awareness |
| Feb 17 | v1beta API for embeddings | text-embedding-004 not available; gemini-embedding-001 is the correct model name |
| Feb 17 | 0.7/0.3 vector/keyword weight | Vector search handles conceptual queries; keyword catches exact matches |

---

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| iOS Share Extension unreliable | Fatal | Medium | Phase 0 gate; contractor must have share extension experience |
| Microlink API rate limits (50/day free) | High | High | Paid plan ($50/mo) or switch to direct scraping |
| Facebook metadata extraction limited | Medium | High | Login wall blocks enrichment; consider oEmbed or manual override |
| Contractor hiring delay | High | Medium | Live demo + architecture doc reduce friction |
| Platform API changes | Medium | High | Cache metadata at save time; build value on curation layer |
| Patent timeline | Low | Low | File provisional ASAP for priority date |
| No technical co-founder | High | High | Use live demo + sharing data to recruit |
| Embedding costs at scale | Medium | Low | Gemini free tier covers prototype; budget $50-100/mo for production |
| Vector search latency | Medium | Low | HNSW index keeps queries <50ms even at 100K+ saves |
